Gnome shell is ok but it's also sort of shitty to look at.

This should 'resolve' the following things:

Remove the excessive border radius on windows.
Shrink the titlebar on normal windows (such as terminal and older gtk2 apps)
Remove the gradients and hilights on teh header/titlebars making it a bit more flat.
